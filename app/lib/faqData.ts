    title: "Why should I tithe?",
    content: `Tithing is a biblical principle that means the tenth. The first tenth, which belongs to God, is Holy and set apart for Him. Tithing is about training our hearts to trust God at His Word. He gave us the greatest gift, His Son, and in response to this gift, we also give.
        Tithing isn’t as much about finances as it is about faith. It’s not about what God wants from you but what He has for you.  <br/><br/>In Malachi 3:10, The Bible says we can test this promise. When we bring our first and best back to God, He promises to bless the rest of our resources so that we could be a blessing toward others.`,

    title: "What’s the difference between the tithe and offerings?",
    content: `As Pastor Todd has shared, "We're never more like Jesus than when we serve and give." In Scripture, we're told that God so loved the world that He gave. Our offerings go beyond the obedience of the tithe; they are a reflection of a life marked by generosity. We believe generosity has a divine purpose connected to it, which is why we invite our church family to give beyond the tithe in one of these ways throughout the year. 
        <br/><br/> <a href="/heart-for-the-house" style="font-weight: bold;">Heart for the House</a> is a special offering we get to be a part of every year, where we give above our regular tithes. Heart for the House goes toward Christ Fellowship's efforts in reaching more people for Jesus—whether that's new or expanded campuses or initiatives, both inside and outside the walls of our church. 
        <br/><br/> <a href="/2023-christ-birthday-offering" style="font-weight: bold;">Christ Birthday Offering</a> is a special offering we get to be a part of every Christmas, where we give above our regular tithes to help fund our mission projects throughout the year. Every dollar you give to Christ Birthday Offering will make a difference toward continuing our impact both locally and globally through our mission projects throughout the year. 
        <br/><br/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Kingdom Builders Fund</span> supports People, Places, and Partnerships in and through Christ Fellowship, including initiatives, strategic partnerships, and building projects in new or existing regions. <a href="/kingdom-builders" style="font-weight: bold;">Learn more about Kingdom Builders.</a>
